  "&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually 
  in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who 
  comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does 
  actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself
  in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the 
  worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
  cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp; nor &nbsp;defeat.&quot;"

<div>Dear all,
<span>I took this really cool course
</span></div>
<span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
my favorite course I've EVER taken!
Here is the URL for it:
</span>
<a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
<div>
Does anyone know how I can give this course 6
out of 5 stars?
</div>

Thank you,
-Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
